Walk around the interior of the restaurant, including storage areas, and look under shelves and equipment for the presence of rodents, cockroaches, small flies, chewed boxes/food/wires, and/or droppings. Walk around the exterior within 10 feet of the restaurant and the corral area to ensure no pest infestation or signs of infestation are present. The corral area is not evaluated in Walmarts or other locations where the corral area is not under the control of the restaurant.</p>
          <p><strong>CITE</strong> for pest infestation as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Un-trapped live rodent(s)</li>
            <li>Any live cockroach(es)</li>
            <li>Any unmanaged or excessive presence of other pests. (e.g. small flies). If greater than 5 small flies are congregating in one area such as drains or areas with stagnant water; this colid indicate a small fly infestation Other examples of “one area” are service area, production area, storage area, or ware washing area”.

            <li>Greater than 5 large flies in one area. If greater than 5 large flies are congregating in one area such as the dining area, food prep area, front counter area, or food storage areas. Large flies are a nuisance to customers and employees and can land on food, but they are not typically considered to be an infestation. They get into the restaurant due to windows and/or doors being left open and if the restaurant does not have a positive air balance.</li>

If not notified, you must ask them to cook the restaurant’s full run size. If conducting a morning visit, you must wait to request this until they begin their lunch transition. Take the internal temperature of the patties following the procedures in the Food Safety Booklet. Refer to the Food Safety Booklet for the definition and procedures for the “full run” size.

Ask them to make the necessary adjustments per the Food Safety booklet and ask the manager to cook another run of patties to ensure that the issue is corrected. Ask the manager to demonstrate that the temperatures are correct; document in your notes that you confirmed that corrective action was taken. Note why the product did not meet temperature and record reason(s) in the GDCT visit form. For an RGRV, you should observe during the transition to regular menu that the restaurant is completing the required food safety checks across all the platens where the product is cooked for the day and that the products meet the internal temperature standard. If they are not completing the required checks or are not taking the proper corrective action if the product temperatures do not meet the standard, this would be cited under FS7-US.</p>

          <p><strong>EXCEPTION:</strong> If you are conducting your internal temperature check during the breakfast to the regular menu transition period and you observe a patty that does not meet the required food safety internal temperature standard, you must notify the manager immediately so that the product is not served.

          Check that when employees handle raw protein products, they are wearing blue disposable gloves or are using dedicated tongs to handle raw protein products. Focus on raw meat, chicken, and shell eggs. Ensure that clear/white gloves are not being used instead of blue gloves to handle raw protein products. If observed, <strong>CITE</strong> under question <strong>FS19-US</strong>.</p>

          <p>Proper Removal of Blue Gloves<br>
          Ensure that blue gloves are removed properly to avoid contacting the portions that came in contact with raw products. They should be peeled off from the base while grabbing from the back of the wrist and pulling off the glove by turning it inside out. They should not be pulled off from fingers or an area that contacted raw products.</p>

          Double gloves are not permitted (unless in rare cases this is being required by local jurisdiction [e.g. Maricopa County, AZ] for our restaurants to be allowed to use the blue disposable gloves). Special requirements are set for these procedures.<br>
          White/clear gloves cannot be worn under Blue gloves. If when informing the Manager that double gloving was observed they state it is required by the local jurisdiction, do not cite.

          <p>All restaurants are required to have a pyrometer with a needle probe for taking temperatures. The majority of restaurants will have a Cooper Atkins pyrometer.

You will require manager assistance with checking the Bluetooth pyrometer calibration.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>If the restaurant has already done its calibration check for its Bluetooth pyrometer for the day, it is acceptable to have the manager show you the verification in the digital food safety checklist. This only applies to the Bluetooth pyrometer.</li>

          <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In order to use DFS the way it is intended, the restaurant does need to use the Bluetooth-enabled pyrometer, but if it is broken or not working they can still use another approved non-Bluetooth pyrometer and manually enter the temperatures.

          <p>Review the last 14 days to verify that the Food Safety Daily Checklists are not missing required sections or days and are being completed according to the appropriate Food Safety Booklet procedures.  Browse through the remaining 60 days of checklists and spot-check a few days for missing required sections or days.</p>
          <p>Check that the restaurant has the last two Monthly Food Safety Procedure Verifications available and completed.</p>
          <p><strong>CITE</strong> for the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>3 or more missing required sections on different days or 3 missing days within the 14 days record review</li>
            <li>The last two Monthly Food Safety Procedure Verifications NOT available and properly completed</li>
            <li>12 or more missing required sections on different days or 12 missing days within the 60 days record spot check</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>COACH</strong> for minor deviations such as a few missing products or refrigerator checks, missing manager signoffs, or not answering the quality questions correctly based on the recorded temperatures.</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not cite if the last two Monthly Food Safety Procedure Verifications are not completed by the 15th of the month.</p>
          <p><strong>For Digital Food Safety Records:</strong><br>
          You DO NOT need to review the last 14 days to verify that checklists are being completed according to the food safety booklet procedures. The software does this automatically.</p>
          <p>You DO need to review that the Food Safety Daily Checklist completion percentage is above 80% for the \past 60 days.<br>
          You DO need to review that the last two Monthly Food Safety Procedure Verifications are available and completed.<br>
          To access these reports on the approved digital food safety apps (JOLT or SQUADLE) ask the manager in charge to show you or verify using the step-by-step procedures, which can be found on the US ROIP Website.</p>
          <p><strong>CITE</strong> for the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Less than 80% completion percentage for the last 60 days of Food Safety Daily Checklists</li>
            <li>The last two Monthly Food Safety Procedure Verifications NOT available and properly completed</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If the restaurant has been on Digital Food Safety less than 60 days or has days missing due to technical issues, you will also have to review Paper Food Safety Checklists using the “For Paper Food Safety Records” assessment criteria listed above.</p>
          <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For other unapproved digital food safety apps, the restaurant must be able to provide the last 60 days of daily food safety checklists and the last two Monthly Food Safety Procedure Verifications for your review, and the same method for the paper checklists must be utilized to assess completion.</p>
